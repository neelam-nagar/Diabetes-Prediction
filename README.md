# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Diabetes Prediction System** developed using **Machine Learning**.
It predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical attributes.

The aim of this project is to assist in **early detection of diabetes** using data-driven techniques.
